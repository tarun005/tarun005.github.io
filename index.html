		<h1> Tarun Kalluri </h1>
			<p> I am a first-year PhD student at the Centre for Visual Computing at UCSD advised by Prof. Manmohan Chandrakar. My research interests span the areas of computer vision and machine learning. I work on problems related to unsupervised learning, learning across domains and transferable representation learning in images. [Our group](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/visualcomputing/ "Centre for Visual Computing") at UCSD works on a wider variety of problems in computer vision involving graphics, 3D reconstruction, material estimation and robotic vision. You can find my CV [here](./CV/CV.pdf)  </p>
