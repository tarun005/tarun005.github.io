<h1> Tarun Kalluri </h1>

<p> I am a first-year PhD student in the CSE department at UCSD. My research interests span the areas of computer vision and machine learning. I am particularly interested in learning compact embeddings of images and videos from limited labeled data that are useful across a wide range of domains and distributions. 
<a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/visualcomputing/" target="_blank">Our group</a> at UCSD works on a wider variety of problems in computer vision involving graphics, 3D reconstruction, material estimation and robotic vision. </p>

<p> Prior to this, I was a research assistant at Centre for Visual Information and Technology <a href="https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank">(CVIT)</a>, IIIT Hyderabad advised by <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/index.html"> Prof. CV Jawahar </a> . I worked on various problems related to semantic understanding from large scale text and image data using techniques in deep learning.</p>

<p> Even before that, I spent a year working as a data scientist at Oracle India, Bangalore. I completed my undergraduation from IIT Guwahati in 2016, with a major in ECE and a minor in CSE. I did my bachelor's thesis on Stochastic Wireless Networks, a field that has kept me busy for long before I started pursuing deep learning. </p>
